# DreamBerd 4

Welcome to the documentation of Dreamberd 4 üéâ
Here you'll find everything you need to know about the project, its features and how to use it!

## Getting started üöÄ

To start using our amazing language, clone the repository and build the binary file:

```

This will install the base dreamberd library packages and build its binary.

## How it works ü§î

If you're here for the technical details, we got you covered too!
You can dive into the architecture documentation explaining how we are [compiling and executing your db4 code](https://docs.dreamberd.fr/#/general/compilation)
